# Development and extension plan for CMF

*Drafted 22 October 2026. The companion of `docs/publication_plan.md`: that document says what gets
written and where it is sent; this one says what gets built, in what order, and what each piece has
to prove before it is allowed to stay. File references point at the code the work starts from.*

## Where the program stands

The repository holds, as of 22 October 2026:

* A library of 29 modules and about 12,000 lines (`cmfqsar/`), a PySide6 application, a
  command-line tool with eleven subcommands (`build`, `predict`, `unalign`, `map`, `explain`,
  `mil`, `hetero`, `pharmacophore`, `difference`, `topomer`, `complement`), 279 tests, a typeset
  manual and a README that doubles as the record of every measurement made so far.
* Closed-form kernels for the five physico-chemical fields, the indicator fields, fields from any
  per-atom property, fitted probe fields, conformational ensembles (mean-map kernels), the
  rotation-invariant autocorrelation kernel and topomer fields; a Gaussian or arc-cosine layer on
  top, and multiple kernel learning for the mixing coefficients.
* Learners: kernel ridge regression, SVR, Gaussian-process regression with variances, SVC, a Laplace
  Gaussian-process classifier, five one-class descriptions, and a multi-task model on a shared
  kernel whose selectivity is a difference of co-fields (`cmfqsar/multitask.py`, measured on the
  corrosion series in `benchmarks/results/multitask/`).
* Interpretation: co-fields, contributions, exact Shapley values under nonlinear kernels, field
  differences, pharmacophores read out of a co-field, pocket complementarity, kernel GTM maps.
* Validation: nested cross-validation, leave-one-chemotype-out, y-randomisation, applicability
  domain, bootstrap intervals, posed decoys with the early-recognition metrics.

The measurements already in hand settle several questions, and the plan treats them as settled:

| Question | Verdict | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Does the kernel matter? | A Gaussian layer gains on average and is a coin flip per set; the alignment decides fifteen times as much | `docs/benchmark.md`, third part |
| Do conformational ensembles help? | Five routes, none beats one well-chosen conformation on an aligned series | README, "The verdict on the fourth dimension" |
| Do probe fields buy accuracy? | No; they are justified by interpretation only | README, "GRID-like probe fields" |
| Do quantum-chemical fields help? | Not on the corrosion series or on Am/Eu; yes on Hammett, where resonance needs whole-molecule charges | `benchmarks/results/corrosion_qm/`, `am_eu/`, `hammett/` |
| Can a Fukui function be a sum of atom Gaussians? | No (relative fit error 0.8 to 0.9), and the model does not care | `cmfqsar/cdft.py`, `benchmarks/results/cdft_kernels/` |
| When do indicator fields pay? | Above about forty molecules | `docs/benchmark.md` |
| Is the one-class ball a good description of the actives? | It comes last of five | README, "One-class models" |
| Does realigning the training set by confidence help? | Not reliably; one round with a 1 Å guard is the safe default | README, "Alignment by prediction confidence" |

What is implemented but has no measurement behind it: Shapley attribution, field differences,
pharmacophore extraction, complementarity, the GP classifier, the one-class descriptions on a real
screening benchmark, and kernel GTM. What is missing as software: packaging,
continuous integration, a release, a versioned model file, gradients of probe fields
(`cmfqsar/kernels.py` raises `NotImplementedError` there), the marginal likelihood for regression
(it exists for the classifier only, in `cmfqsar/gpc.py`), and a way to screen more molecules than
fit in memory.

## Rules the plan follows

1. **Every extension is measured against the five-field, single-conformation model on the same
   folds before it becomes a default.** The fourth-dimension study is the template: five routes
   tried, all reported, the mode kept because it is exact and costs nothing when unused.
2. **The model stays linear in the field wherever a co-field is wanted.** Anything nonlinear gets
   Shapley values instead, and anything that cannot produce either is not a CMF model.
3. **The kernel stays in closed form.** Grids are for measurement and display; the conceptual-DFT
   study showed that an exact grid kernel does no better than a fitted one.
4. **A difference below the bootstrap interval is not a result.** On a series of twenty to thirty
   molecules that is about 0.1 in q²; every comparison on such a set is reported with its interval.
5. **A module without a benchmark script is a candidate for removal.** The benchmark directory
   is the proof that a feature does something; a feature that cannot be measured is documented as
   a display tool, as the probe fields are.
6. **The rebuild is one command.** Every table in the documentation is produced by a script under
   `benchmarks/`, and the numbers reproduce on a machine that is not this one.

## A. The platform (months 0 to 3)

This is what the software paper needs, and nothing in the later parts should wait for it.

* **A1. Packaging.** Done 22 October 2026 for the part that lives in the repository:
  `pyproject.toml` with the version read from `cmfqsar/__init__.py`, the commands `cmf` and
  `cmf-app`, extras `gui`, `docs`, `dev`, `examples` and `all` so the library installs without Qt
  (there is no `orca` extra, since ORCA is a program and not a package), the command-line tool
  moved into the package as `cmfqsar/cli.py` with `cmf_cli.py` left as a launcher,
  `requirements-lock.txt` with the versions the benchmarks were run under, and `CITATION.cff`.
  Still to do, once the repository is public: the v1.0 tag and the Zenodo DOI.
* **A2. Continuous integration.** Done 22 October 2026: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the
  suite on Ubuntu, Windows and macOS with Python 3.10 and 3.13 from `pyproject.toml`, once more
  from `requirements-lock.txt` with the manual typeset, and the GUI autotest under the offscreen
  Qt platform on every job, failing unless it reports success. The suite takes 23 s and its
  slowest tests are numerical integrations, not embeddings, so the shared fixture this item
  foresaw was not needed. Verified locally on Windows step by step; the Linux and macOS legs run
  for the first time on the first push.
* **A3. The data statement.** Done 22 October 2026 as the record: `docs/public_3dqsar_datasets.md`
  gives every set under `examples/` its origin, terms, script, size, users and a status (free,
  derived, unclear). Four items are of unclear status, `sutherland/`, `steroids_cbg.sdf` and the
  two derived from the first; the document says what replacing each copy by its script would
  cost, and the decision to remove them before the repository is public is the author's, not
  taken here. Two further gaps it names: the corrosion exports lack per-compound references, and
  the Hammett constants were transcribed from memory and must be checked against the table.
* **A4. One entry point for the tables.** `benchmarks/run_all.py` rebuilds every table in
  `docs/benchmark.md` and the README from the result files, and a manifest records the package
  versions and the data hashes each result was produced from. Kernels computed per α are cached on
  disk and reused across scripts that share a set.
* **A5. A versioned model file.** The manual's list "What has to match between fitting and
  predicting" becomes a checked contract: the model file carries its parameterisation, charge model,
  scaling convention, field list and version, and `predict` refuses or warns on a mismatch rather
  than predicting silently with the wrong increments.
* **A6. Land the multi-task model.** Done 22 October 2026: `cmfqsar/multitask.py`, its test, the
  selectivity dialog and `benchmarks/run_multitask.py` are committed with the result on the
  corrosion series (README, "Two endpoints on one kernel"; `benchmarks/results/multitask/table.md`).
  The first run of the benchmark had a correlation grid of non-negative values against a pair of
  anti-correlated endpoints and could not have found the sharing; the grid now covers both signs.

## B. Scale and speed (months 2 to 6)

The kernels are vectorised NumPy over atom pairs (`cmfqsar/kernels.py`): a 300-molecule set takes
seconds per α, the 86-set benchmark hours, and the 130 decapeptides of `mittal/AMPH1` cost fourteen
times a normal set. None of this blocks a congeneric series; all of it blocks screening and the
larger searches in parts C and E.

* **B1. Share the distance matrix across α.** The grid search computes a kernel per α; the
  squared distances do not change. Compute them once per molecule pair and take the exponentials for
  every α from the same array; for the steric field the width enters through `b = α/R²`, which is
  the same block with a different scalar.
* **B2. A cutoff with a neighbour list.** A Gaussian overlap is below 10⁻⁶ of its peak beyond
  about `7/√α` Å. A KD-tree neighbour list per molecule pair turns the atom-pair sum from quadratic
  in atoms to linear for large molecules, with an exact fallback and a test that the two agree.
* **B3. Prediction out of core.** Predicting needs only the rows `K(X, X_train)`, so a screening
  run over 10⁵ posed molecules should stream through an SDF and never hold more than one block. The
  CLI gets a `screen` subcommand that does this, with the decoy posing of `cmfqsar/decoys.py`.
* **B4. Hyper-parameters by evidence rather than cross-validation.** The GP marginal likelihood is
  implemented for the classifier (`select_by_evidence` in `cmfqsar/gpc.py`) and not for regression,
  where it is one determinant and one quadratic form on the factorisation KRR already does.
  Selecting α and λ by evidence costs one factorisation per candidate instead of ten, and it opens the door to
  per-field α, which the 2013 protocol shared across fields because a grid over five widths was
  unaffordable. Measure on the 86 sets: evidence against cross-validation, shared α against per-field
  α, with the usual intervals.
* **B5. Optional compiled kernels.** Only if B1 and B2 leave screening too slow: a Numba path for the
  atom-pair block, behind the same function signature, with the NumPy path as the reference.

## C. The alignment problem (months 3 to 12)

This is the scientific centre of the plan. The 2019 paper's *Future perspective* names alignment and
flexibility as the unsolved problem of 3D-QSAR and proposes solving it by maximising prediction
confidence; the benchmarks since then show that the alignment decides more than anything else; and the
confidence criterion is implemented, recovers scrambled test poses to 0.27 Å on thrombin, but does not
reliably improve a training set. The work is to turn one criterion into a method with a protocol that
can judge it.

* **C1. A protocol that can judge an alignment.** q² cannot, because realigning changes the
  geometry q² is computed on, and the README records q² and external R²pred moving in opposite
  directions. The judge is the crystal pose: the FEP sets with pockets (`examples/openff`,
  `schindler`, `ross`) have one for every ligand. Metrics: RMSD of the recovered pose to the crystal
  pose, and prediction error on held-out molecules posed without their activity. Both, always, and the
  unalign control (`cmf_cli.py unalign`) before every run.
* **C2. Flexible alignment by confidence.** The present search is rigid-body with analytic
  gradients. Add the torsions, with the conformer generator supplying starting points and the
  kernel gradient already in `kernel_gradient` extended by the chain rule over rotatable bonds. The
  objective becomes posterior confidence times a prior on the conformer energy, which is the
  proposal of the 2019 paper in full. Probe-field gradients, now `NotImplementedError`, are filled in
  on the way so every field can take part.
* **C3. Alignment inside the pocket.** `cmfqsar/docking.py` places conformations rigidly and
  `cmfqsar/complementarity.py` scores them against the pocket fields. Use complementarity as the
  prior and confidence as the likelihood: the pose must fit the pocket and sit inside the model's
  domain. Measure against the curated frames on the FEP sets, where the curated frame is the
  crystal pose and the ceiling is known.
* **C4. Training-set co-alignment done properly.** The present iteration (fit, realign, refit)
  contracts the ensemble and degrades one set in four. Treat it as what it is, an expectation-
  maximisation over poses, and regularise it: the displacement guard, a leave-one-out variance so no
  molecule is aligned against itself, and an annealed λ. Judge under C1 only.
* **C5. A richer invariant kernel.** The field autocorrelation kernel (`cmfqsar/invariant.py`) is
  alignment-free and geometry-aware but two-point, so it is blind to chirality and to the
  orientation of one field with respect to another. A three-point extension (field triples, or the
  cross-correlation of two field types) keeps the closed form and is the natural next term. Measure
  on the five chemotype-split sets under leave-one-chemotype-out, where the alignment-free baseline
  already sets the bar.
* **C6. A diagnosis of the data set.** Three diagnostics exist in pieces: α at the grid edge, the
  descriptor-only baseline that beat the 3D model on ACE, and the alignment-free baseline. Package
  them as `cmf diagnose`, which says before any modelling whether the frame carries signal, whether
  the series is congeneric enough for a frame to exist, and which of the three routes (aligned,
  topomer, invariant) the set should take. This is also the measurement that papers 3 and 4 share.

## D. Fields and kernels (months 3 to 9)

* **D1. Anisotropic atom functions.** The conceptual-DFT study found that isotropic Gaussians on
  atoms cannot represent a Fukui function. Gaussians times first-order polynomials (p-type functions)
  still have closed-form overlaps; one set per atom along the bond directions is the smallest
  extension that can represent a lobe. Repeat the fit-error measurement on the four corrosion series
  with ORCA results, and keep the extension only if the fit error drops and the model notices.
* **D2. Pharmacophoric indicator fields.** Sybyl-type indicator fields pay only above about forty
  molecules because there are many types and each is rare. A vocabulary of six pharmacophore
  features (donor, acceptor, aromatic, hydrophobe, cation, anion) is learnable on small series and
  reads directly as a pharmacophore. Measure on the Sutherland sets against the five fields and
  against the Sybyl indicators, split by set size as before.
* **D3. A cheap quantum stage.** ORCA takes two to three minutes per molecule serially, so the
  quantum fields have been tried on a few series only. GFN2-xTB through `tblite` gives charges and
  Fukui indices in seconds, which puts a quantum stage on all 86 sets within reach. The Hammett
  result says where to expect a gain (resonance) and the corrosion result says where not to; the
  question is whether the 86 sets contain any series of the first kind.
* **D4. Protonation and tautomer ensembles.** The corrosion series in HCl are modelled in one
  protonation state. The mean-map kernel needs only bilinearity, so an ensemble over protonation
  states weighted by pKa is the same mathematics as a conformer ensemble; but `ensemble_fields` in
  `cmfqsar/fields.py` tiles one atom list over the members (`atoms_per_conformer`), and the atom
  contributions and the GUI read it that way. Generalise the builder to members with their own
  atoms, with a conformer ensemble as the special case that must reproduce the present numbers
  exactly, then measure on `examples/corrosion_hcl` against the single state.
* **D5. Learned increments.** The two parameterisations differ by 0.20 in q² on AChE, which says
  the hydrophobic and hydrogen-bond increments are not settled. Fit the per-type increments jointly
  with the model (gradient of the cross-validation loss through the kernel, with the published
  increments as the prior and a penalty on the distance from them), and ask the only question that
  matters: do increments learned on one set transfer to another? If they do not, the result is that
  the increments are a per-set nuisance parameter and the plan says so.
* **D6. Per-field widths.** Follows from B4: once the evidence selects hyper-parameters, α per field
  is five numbers instead of one, and the co-fields become sharper for the field that wants it.

## E. Learning (months 4 to 10)

* **E1. Multi-task beyond two tasks.** After A6: a free-form low-rank task covariance for several
  endpoints, task descriptors (the medium, the metal, the temperature) so that an endpoint with no
  measurements at all can be predicted from its neighbours, and the selectivity co-field in the GUI
  as the difference of two co-fields. The Am/Eu problem is the first application; separations of
  other lanthanide and actinide pairs the next.
* **E2. Active learning: which molecule to make next.** The GP variance is in hand. An acquisition
  loop over a set of posed candidates (expected improvement, or variance alone for exploration)
  turns the 2019 statement "maximising the overlap tells how to modify the molecule" into an
  operation with a number. Retrospective benchmark on the Sutherland sets: start from twenty
  molecules, add one at a time by acquisition or at random, and plot the learning curves with
  their intervals.
* **E3. Co-field-guided design.** The field difference says what a candidate is missing and the
  pharmacophore says where. Close the loop: enumerate replacements of a substituent at a position
  from a fragment library, pose them by the topomer rule (`cmfqsar/topomer.py`) so no alignment is
  needed, score by predicted activity and posterior variance, and present the ranked list with the
  field difference of the top candidates. This is the first feature that makes a prediction the
  user did not ask for, and the GUI needs a panel for it.
* **E4. Screening done on a public benchmark.** The one-class, GP-classifier and decoy machinery has
  been measured on the actives of the Sutherland sets against generated decoys only. Paper 8 needs
  DUD-E or LIT-PCBA subsets with posed decoys, the comparison with fingerprint similarity on the
  same task, and positive-unlabelled learning, since the inactives of a screening set are unlabelled
  rather than inactive.
* **E5. Error prediction compared.** Three quantities claim to predict the error of a prediction:
  the GP variance, the kernel applicability-domain measure, and (to be added) a conformal interval
  on top of KRR. Compare them on the 86 sets as predictors of the actual external error, which is
  the measurement paper 8 is missing.
* **E6. Bayesian mixing.** Multiple kernel learning picks one set of mixing coefficients. A
  hierarchical prior over `h_f` with the evidence as the objective gives a posterior over the field
  weights, and with it an answer to "does this series care about the steric field at all" with an
  interval rather than a point.

## F. Interpretation (months 4 to 9)

* **F1. Case studies.** Shapley values, field differences, pharmacophores and complementarity have
  tests but no story. Three FEP series with crystal pockets, each worked through end to end in a
  script under `examples/` and a section of the manual, judged by a medicinal chemist. Paper 7 is
  written from these.
* **F2. The uncertainty of a co-field.** The co-field is `Σ a_j X_j(r)`; under the GP the dual
  coefficients have a posterior covariance, so the co-field has a posterior variance at every grid
  point in closed form. Render only the regions where the co-field exceeds twice its standard
  deviation; the rest of the isosurface is noise and should not be shown. This is cheap, new, and
  changes what every co-field picture means.
* **F3. Co-fields compared.** The overlap of two co-fields is a closed-form similarity between two
  models: two targets (selectivity, again), two series on one target, or one series across rounds
  of active learning. A table of co-field overlaps is a map of SAR transfer.
* **F4. A model report.** One command that writes an HTML or PDF report of a model: statistics,
  the three validation checks, the co-field pictures from fixed viewpoints, the Shapley table for
  the extremes of the series, and the pharmacophore. This is what a user hands to a colleague who
  will never start the application.
* **F5. Pharmacophore export.** The typed features with tolerance spheres of
  `cmfqsar/pharmacophore.py` in a format a pharmacophore-screening program can read, so the
  co-field can be used as a query outside CMF.

## G. The application and the tool (continuous)

* **G1. Subcommands.** Alignment is spread over flags of `build` and `predict` and the `hetero`
  subcommand; give it a subcommand of its own, `align` (by confidence, by MCS, in the pocket), and
  add `diagnose` (C6), `screen` (B3), `cofield` (grids and cube export without the GUI), `report`
  (F4) and `benchmark` (A4).
* **G2. Projects.** A project file that holds the data set, its poses before and after each
  alignment, the settings, the model and the results, so a session can be reopened; undo of an
  alignment step; a panel that compares two models on the same molecules.
* **G3. The library as an interface.** The classes the README already presents (`CMFModel`,
  `FieldSet`, `AtomTable`, `Dataset`) become the documented stable surface, with a notebook per
  workflow (aligned series, frameless series, screening) under `examples/`.
* **G4. The manual grows with the program.** Each feature lands with its manual section and its
  benchmark script in the same commit, as the probe fields and descriptors did; `docs/make_manual.py`
  rebuilds the PDF.
* **G5. Other platforms.** The application has been run on Windows only. Linux and macOS through A2
  first, then the high-DPI and OpenGL differences the 3D view will meet there.

## H. Beyond medicinal chemistry (year 2)

The 2019 paper names materials design as a target; the Am/Eu result, where geometry is decisive
and counts predict nothing, is the first case.

* **Separations.** Extractant series for other ion pairs with the multi-task model; the
  selectivity co-field as the design tool.
* **Catalysis and physical organic chemistry.** The Hammett paper is the entry: ligand libraries
  with a shared frame (phosphines, N-heterocyclic carbenes) and rate or selectivity as the
  activity. Sybyl typing has to be extended for metal centres before the indicator fields apply.
* **Peptides.** `mittal/AMPH1` is 130 decapeptides that no configuration models, and the reason is
  a 3.2 Å superposition error over a flexible chain. It is the test case for C2 and C3 together, and
  the plan expects it to stay hard.
* **Field-based similarity for reactions.** Fields of reactant and product in one frame, with the
  difference field as the description of the transformation. Exploratory; no commitment until C is
  done.

## Sequence

| When | What |
|---|---|
| Months 0 to 3 | A (platform), A6 first; B1 and B2 as they are needed by the benchmarks |
| Months 2 to 6 | B4 (evidence), D6, C1 (the protocol) and C2 (flexible alignment); F2 (co-field uncertainty) |
| Months 3 to 9 | D1 to D5; C3 to C6; F1 (case studies) |
| Months 4 to 10 | E1 to E6; G1 and G2 alongside |
| Months 6 to 12 | F3 to F5; H begins with separations |
| Year 2 | H; the review that ties the series together |

The order inside a part follows the dependencies: nothing in C or E is judged without the protocol
of C1 and the intervals of rule 4; D6 and E6 wait for B4; E3 waits for E2 and the topomer rule;
F2 wants the GP view that B4 makes the default.

## What is not planned

* **Neural networks on fields.** A 3D convolutional network on a field grid gives up the closed-form
  kernel, the co-field and the exactness of the Shapley values at once. The nonlinear kernel layer
  and the Shapley decomposition already cover the case where a linear model is not enough.
* **A web service.** The program is a desktop application and a library; serving it is a different
  project.
* **General docking.** The pocket placement in `cmfqsar/docking.py` exists to pose conformations for
  a field model, not to compete with docking programs; C3 uses it as a prior and no more.

## Risks

* **Breadth.** Twenty-nine modules and one author. Rule 5 is the control: a feature that cannot be
  measured is documented as a display tool or removed, and the test count rises with every module
  that stays.
* **Data for the alignment work.** The FEP sets are the only series with a crystal pose for every
  ligand, and their activity ranges are narrow. Congeneric series from PDBbind with several
  structures per series are the next source and should be collected during A3.
* **The confidence criterion may not be enough.** C2 to C4 may show that confidence alone cannot
  pose a flexible molecule without a pocket. That is a result, not a failure, and the alignment-free
  route of C5 and the diagnosis of C6 are the plan's answer to it.
* **Dependencies.** ORCA is the serial build and xTB is not yet in the tool chain; RDKit's MMFF set-up
  alters aromaticity flags in place, so every new module that optimises geometry must re-sanitise, as
  the conformer generator does.
